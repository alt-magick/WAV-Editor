Edit WAV Files As Spread Sheets

WAV files are made up of a series of ampliudes from quiet to loud.  

Each sample has an amplitude represented by a number.

Multiple samples create sound waves that we recognize.

This program creates a spread sheet made up of each sample in a wav file.

To convert a WAV file into CSV type:

wav2data.exe file.wav output.csv

You can now edit it in Excel or Calc.

And ChatGPT can modify your CSV file with AI.

When you finish type:

data2wav.exe output.csv new.wav

And you will have a new WAV file.

The CSV file shows the values of the right and left channels in a WAV.

As well as the time in seconds for each sample.

Your csv file should look something like this:



| First Header  | Second Header |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Content Cell  | Content Cell  |
